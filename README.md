# NYU-Tandon-Bridge-2021

![nyu-logo](./assets/nyu_logo.jpg)

I'm Jason! I most recently worked as a Software Engineer, Frontend at a fintech company in Palo Alto, CA. My technical background comes from self-study and a full-stack software engineering bootcamp. I'm excited to be taking this course through NYU to reinforce my fundamental understanding of computer science.

## Program Description

The bridge program is an intensive study of the required topics which are requisite information for general admission into the NYU-Tandon CSE graduate program. Conventionally, covering these topics take three to four semesters to complete and must be done sequentially. Under the bridge program, you will complete your studies in one, intensive, semester which includes all of the material from the conventional courses in a more compact form. The bridge will require as much as 100 hours of study, but scheduling of each module can be done at a time of your discretion, due to the online nature of the program. Working at an average of about 16 hours of study each week, the bridge program will be completed in one semester. You are expected, and required to attend a weekly online meeting as well.

## Program Objectives 

By the end of the CS Bridge Program students should have:
1. Basic understanding of how data is represented and how computers execute instructions
to use and modify data in order to solve problems.
2. Understanding of computational thinking: how to develop algorithms using decisions,
repetition, and decomposition into manageable components to solve problems.
3. Ability to implement and test moderate sized programs in C++, using constructs
including variables, operators, decision statements, loops, functions, and built-in data
types.
4. Ability to understand basic object-oriented programming concepts.
5. Ability to code, use, analyze the performance of, and modify fundamental data structures.
6. Have a firm understanding of operating systems topics related to processes, threads,
thread concurrency, deadlocks, and memory management.
7. Understanding of fundamental concepts in discrete math.
