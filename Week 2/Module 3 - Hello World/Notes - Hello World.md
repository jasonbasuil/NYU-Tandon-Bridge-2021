# Module 3 - Hello World

**_Process of Executing a Program_**

> Secondary memory. It could house an application / instructions laid out in bytes in 0's and 1's. It may at be at some address, say 1 or 58 or 100. 1 - 100 might be our application (prog.exe)
>
> RAM. Those bytes are brought into RAM.
>
> CPU. Has a program counter register that executes those instructions from RAM one after the other. Goes through the fetch, decode, execute cycle.

**_Compilation_**

> Code => build process (automated) => Machine language (0's and 1's)
>
> We'll use a high level programming language C++
> much closer to our natural language
