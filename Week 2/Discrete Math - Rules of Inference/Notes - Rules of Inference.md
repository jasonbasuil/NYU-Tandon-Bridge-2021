## 1.11 - Logical reasoning

**_argument_** is a sequence of propositions called **_hypotheses_**, followed by a final proposition called the **_conclusion_**. An argument is **_valid_** if the conclusion is true whenever the hypotheses are all true, otherwise the argument is **_invalid_**.

> p1 ... pn are the hypotheses and c is the conclusion. The symbol ∴ reads "therefore". The argument is valid whenever the proposition ( p1 ∧ p2 ∧ ... ∧ pn ) → c is a tautology.

**_The form of an argument_**

> The hypotheses and conclusion in a logical argument can also be expressed in English, as in:
>
> It is raining today.
>
> If it is raining today, I will not ride my bike to school.
>
> ∴ I will not ride my bike to school.

**_form_** of an argument expressed in English is obtained by replacing each individual proposition with a variable. While it is common to express a logical argument in English, the validity of an argument is established by analyzing its form. Define propositional variables p and q to be:

> p: It is raining today.
>
> q: I will not ride my bike to school.
