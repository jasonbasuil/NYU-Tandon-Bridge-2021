  > Each int data uses 4 bytes (32 bits) in memory.
  > disadvantage of fixed sized data (2^32 = about 4 billion). If you want to use a number exponentially large, it might be a problem.
  > The numbers are represented using the 2's complement method
  > 2 Forms of data: variables & constants
  > C++ literals
  > C++ is a strongly typed language
