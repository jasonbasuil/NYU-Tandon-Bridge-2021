## 1.6 - Predicates and quantifiers

**_predicate_** a logical statement whose truth value is a function of one or more variables

> x is odd.
> 16 = x^2

**_domain_** of a variable in a predicate is the set of all possible values for the variable.

**_universal quantifier_** ∀

> The logical statement ∀x P(x) is read "for all x, P(x)" or "for every x, P(x)".
> The statement ∀x P(x) asserts that P(x) is true for every possible value for x in its domain.
> The symbol ∀ is a **universal quantifier** and the statement ∀x P(x) is called a **universally quantified statement**.
> ∀x P(x) is a proposition because it is either true or false. ∀x P(x) is true if and only if P(n) is true for every n in the domain.

**_counterexample_** for a universally quantified statement is an element in the domain for which the predicate is false.

> For example, consider the statement ∀x (x2 > x), in which the domain is the set of positive integers.
> When x = 1, then x2 = x and the statement x2 > x is not true.
> Therefore x = 1 is a counterexample that shows the statement "∀x (x2 > x)" is false.

**_existential quantifier_** ∃

> The logical statement ∃x P(x) is read "There exists an x, such that P(x)".
> The statement ∃x P(x) asserts that P(x) is true for at least one possible value for x in its domain.
> The symbol ∃ is an **existential quantifier** and the statement ∃x P(x) is called a **existentially quantified statement**.
